We are introducing “MENTORINFO.apk“ 
the android application which would help the faculty to track the progress of the students/trainees. 
This application allows the faculty to keep track of their students and run reports to monitor the progress of mentoring activity , anticipate
graduation rates and draw insights for drop-out rates. 
Use goals to track progress, set goals for new year and review accomplishments of previous years. 
Our intention is to establish a good communication between Student Mentor and parent
